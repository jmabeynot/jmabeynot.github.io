   (In compliance with the No Surprises Act of 12/27/2020)

You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your medical care will cost. Under the law,
health care providers need to give patients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of
the bill for medical items and services.

- You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency items or
  services. This includes related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment, and hospital fees.
- Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least 1 business day before  your
  medical service or item. You can also ask your health care provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good
  Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service.
- If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill.
- Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate. For questions or more information about your right
  to a Good Faith Estimate, visit https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises or call 800-985-3059.

*Your Good Faith Estimate will be included with the other intake forms provided after the phone consultation, and will*
*be consistent with the information on this website.*
