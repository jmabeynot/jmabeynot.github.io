You are gifted at recognizing and nurturing the needs of others, but tend to let your own needs go by the wayside.

You would love to feel balanced, in control of your emotions, confident about life and secure in your relationships.
Instead *depression*, *anxiety*, *trauma* or *family of origin issues* have left you struggling to:

- Maintain healthy relationships at home and work.
- Set healthy boundaries.
- Regulate your emotions.

The right support can make all the difference as you work to change patterns and behavior.

Mend Mental Health Therapy is where you, who spend so much of your life focused on serving others, can focus on your
own well-being.  Making sure your needs are met will help you continue to serve others from a place of strength
instead of depletion.  Healing is possible!

      procedures if you're interested in reimbursement.

   When it comes to therapy, there is no “one size fits all” approach.  I am trained in several therapeutic
   modalities, and we will work together to discover your best path forward.  As your partner in healing, I will be
   flexible and the path will be tailored to your needs.


Approaches
==========


.. bs-row::

   .. bs-icon-box:: EMDR
      :subtitle: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
      :icon-class: bi bi-bullseye
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Learn to use bilateral stimulation to overcome negative emotions
      and body sensations connected to past trauma so you can
      shift into a mindset that feels safe, capable and valued.


   .. bs-icon-box:: Mindful Self-Compassion
      :icon-class: bi bi-chat-heart
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Develop greater self-awareness and shift your relationship
      with yourself from harsh critic to encouraging friend.


   .. bs-icon-box:: ACT
      :subtitle: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      :icon-class: bi bi-arrow-left-right
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Your thoughts are not your boss.
      Develop a new relationship with and take control of your thoughts
      as you learn to notice, detach from, and evaluate them.


   .. bs-icon-box:: LI
      :subtitle: Lifespan Integration
      :icon-class: bi bi-map
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Get a more current perspective on past traumatic experiences
      and develop a coherent sense of self
      while learning to recognize your strengths and resources.


   .. bs-icon-box:: Mind-Body Bridging
      :icon-class: bi bi-link
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Engage your wisest self as you become more present
      in your body and calm down your “fight, flight or freeze”
      response so you can move in goal-oriented ways.

   Jen Mabey, CMHC


I am licensed in the State of Utah (License # 11283706-6004) as a Clinical Mental Health Counselor (CMHC). I
graduated from the University of Utah with a Master’s Degree in Educational Psychology/Clinical Mental Health
Counseling.

I am fascinated by research showing that when parents struggle with illness, addiction, or narcissism, or expect
their children’s achievements to make them look good, their children often later choose careers in healthcare and
other helping professions.  It turns out such family-of-origin experiences hone one’s ability to tune into what
others expect and need, but often such talented caregivers haven’t learned to tune into what they themselves need.  I
enjoy connecting with and supporting those in helping professions to build skills and insight, process painful
experiences, and be better prepared to lead the life they desire.

When I’m not in my therapy office, I teach people how to play the violin, renovate and landscape my old house, try to
train my dog to behave himself, and enjoy spending time with my family and friends.
