As a healthcare provider, you are gifted at recognizing and nurturing the needs of others, but may struggle to
identify and address your own mental health needs.

You long to feel balanced, in control of your emotions, confident about life and secure in your relationships.
Instead *depression*, *anxiety* and *family of origin issues* have left you

- Distressed and distracted by intrusive thoughts and painful memories that interfere with work and relationships.
- Depleted and irritable from the struggle to set healthy boundaries.
- Increasingly anxious and despondent as the strategies you use to regulate your emotions fail to help you feel better.

Without experienced support to help you work through them, these challenges will only continue to interfere with your
work, interpersonal relationships and personal happiness.

Please know you are not alone and healing is possible.

   When it comes to therapy, there is no “one size fits all” approach. I am trained in several therapeutic approaches,
   so we have options as we figure out what works best for you.


Approaches
==========


.. bs-row::

   .. bs-icon-box:: EMDR
      :subtitle: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
      :icon-class: bi bi-bullseye
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Learn to use bilateral stimulation to overcome negative emotions
      and body sensations connected to past trauma so you can
      shift into a mindset that feels safe, capable and valued.


   .. bs-icon-box:: Mindful Self-Compassion
      :icon-class: bi bi-chat-heart
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Develop greater self-awareness and shift your relationship
      with yourself from harsh critic to encouraging friend.


   .. bs-icon-box:: ACT
      :subtitle: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      :icon-class: bi bi-arrow-left-right
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Your thoughts are not your boss.
      Develop a new relationship with and take control of your thoughts
      as you learn to notice, detach from and evaluate them.


   .. bs-icon-box:: LI
      :subtitle: Lifespan Integration
      :icon-class: bi bi-map
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Get a more current perspective on past traumatic experiences
      and develop a coherent sense of self
      while learning to recognize your strengths and resources.


   .. bs-icon-box:: Mind-Body Bridging
      :icon-class: bi bi-link
      :col-class: align-items-stretch col-lg-4 col-md-6 mb-3 d-flex

      Engage your wisest self as you become more present
      in your body and calm down your “fight, flight or freeze”
      response so you can move in goal-oriented ways.

   Jen Mabey, CMHC


I am licensed in the State of Utah as a Clinical Mental Health Counselor (CMHC). I earned a M.Ed. in Educational
Psychology/Clinical Mental Health Counseling from the University of Utah. I chose that route to becoming a therapist
because it offered the most focused coursework on providing individual therapy to adults, which is the kind of
therapy I wanted to practice.

During school, I studied research about the impact of having parents who were focused
on achievement that would reflect well on the parent or were focused on something else due to illness, addiction,
narcissism, etc., and learned that these children often later chose careers in healthcare and other helping
professions. These backgrounds honed their ability to tune in to what others expected and needed, but often did not
nurture their ability to tune in to what they themselves needed. I enjoy connecting with and supporting this
population, helping them to build skills and insight, process painful experiences, and be better prepared to lead the
life they desire.

When I’m not in the therapy chair, I teach people how to play the violin, renovate and landscape my old house, try to
train my dog to behave himself, and enjoy spending time with my family and friends.
